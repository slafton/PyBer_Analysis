# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of the analysis was to compare ride-share data by city type (urban, suburban and rural) for the months of January, February, March and April. We are looking for the relationship between type of city and drivers and riders. 

## Results
  * Total rides were highest and urban and lowest in rural.
  * Drivers were highest in urban and lowest in rural.
  * Total fares was highest in urban cities and lowest in rural.
  * Average fare per ride was highest in rural and lowest in urban.
  * Average fare per driver was highest in rural and lowest in urban. 
 
 ### The findings are shown in this table summary.

### This line graph shows additional insights such as all city types seeing a spike in late February.

## Summary
### It makes since that the cost of ride-shares is higher in less populated areas as the drivers likely have to drive further in those areas to service. Adding data that takes into consideration the miles driven could be useful to further explore the relationship between the city size and average fare cost. Also suburban areas tend to be more business orientated while urban is more housing. The cost of living could greatly influence the numbers we are seeing. To address disparities within the cities it may be useful to break the cities into sections and pull data from each section to compare. This would allow deeper insight into which specific areas need more drivers. To provide affordable ride-shares to underserved neighborhoods an incentive progam could be initiated to pull drivers to those areas.
