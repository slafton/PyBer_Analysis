# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of the analysis was to compare ride-share data by city type (urban, suburban and rural) for the months of January, February, March and April. We are looking for the relationship between type of city and drivers and riders. 

## Results
### From the table below we can see that rural city types had the least rides and drivers but had the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. Suburban was in the middle and Urban had the most rides and drivers with the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver.

### The line graph below reiterates our previous findings as well as gives us a visual. We can see that there are peaks at the end of February for all city types.

## Summary
### It makes since that the cost of ride-shares is higher in less populated areas as the drivers likely have to drive further in those areas to service. Adding data that takes into consideration the miles driven could be useful to further explore the relationship between the city size and average fare cost. Also suburban areas tend to be more business orientated while urban is more housing. The cost of living could greatly influence the numbers we are seeing. To address disparities within the cities it may be useful to break the cities into sections and pull data from each section to compare. This would allow deeper insight into which specific areas need more drivers. To provide affordable ride-shares to underserved neighborhoods an incentive progam could be initiated to pull drivers to those areas.
